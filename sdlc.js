/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step the requirements of users and various other stakeholders are researched, considered, and documented to ensure that the software being developed meets the needs of the user while also reamaining within a realisitic scope for the other parties involved in the process."

const design = "Once the requirements are determined and understood, the software can now be designed. In this step the structures within which the software will operate are established and solutions to any problems presented by the requirements are addressed through processes such as modeling and storyboarding. This allows for early inspection, prototyping, and simulation of the proposed design in ordter to catch any possible problems before the actual code construction begins."

const implementation = "Once the design has been established, it is now time to build the actual software. The design is implemented using appropriate programming languages to achieve the requirements of the project. This is a collaboration between many people including engineers, developers, project managers, and more. These people work together using various possible methodologies such as waterfall, agile, RAD, etc. depending on the team and specifics of the project. Regardless of methodology, the team will work togetehr using peer and team review to ensure quality software is produced in the fastest way possible."

const testingAndIntegration = "Once the initial design of the software has been pulled together, it is put through testing using pre-planned scenerious to ensure that the software will perform as expected and to catch any unexpected issues before it is deployed. Once the concerns found through the testing process are addressed, the software can then be deployed or integrated (depending on whether it is totally new or building upon an existing piece of softward). This makes the software available for use to the user. More issues will likely be raised by users once the software is deployed, so additional rounds of fixes will more than likely be necessary as part of this process."

const maintain = "Once the software is out in the world it must be maintained. This can include fixing bugs, measuring the success of the software vs. the stated goals, developing updates to adjust to the everchanging software/hardware landscape, and tracking how user experiences are and making needed adjustments to improve upon any shortcomings in that realm."
